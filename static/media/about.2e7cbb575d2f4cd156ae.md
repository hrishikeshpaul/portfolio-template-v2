I am a budding Data Analyst from Eau Claire, Wisconsin looking to exert myself into a fully-driven career one data project at a time.

My love for exploring, analyzing, and interpreting data led me to pursue a career as a Data Analyst. I am highly proficient in **MySQL**, a beginner in **JavaScript**, and **Python**, and can seamlessly plug into **Tableau** and **PowerBI** to drive informed decision-making and provide real-time insights.

I am always seeking out new challenges to learn and grow both personally and professionally. Whether it's searching for rare vinyl gems or conquering new running trails, I am eager to push myself beyond my comfort zone. My commitment to excellence and passion for data fuels my excitement to apply my skills to projects that make a real-world impact.

Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è nice to meet you! I'm a _Frontend Software Engineer_ at [Reputation](https://reputation.com/) based out of Chicago, Illinois.

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for writing code and making things on the web look pretty. I'm well acquainted with various *UX design* & *research methods* as well as *frontend*, *backend*, *database* and *cloud technologies*. I have always been a firm believer in the human element of design and knowing your audience. Therefore, I strive to create simple, functional and impactful user experiences.  I primarily code in **Python** and **Typescript**, and use **Adobe XD** and **Illustrator** for designing.

In my free time, I love to play volleyball, watch football ‚öΩ, cook, play the guitar, explore neighborhoods through food and occasionally bring out my inner photographer. Also, did someone say sushi? üç£
